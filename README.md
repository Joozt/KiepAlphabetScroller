# KiepAlphabetScroller
### A C# WPF application that shows a large alphabet carousel overlay for text input

The letters can be choosen with the mouse scrollwheel and entered with a mouse click. The application is not finished yet (scrolling and entering only works when the carousel has focus, but then the text input is not sent to the actual application behind it).
